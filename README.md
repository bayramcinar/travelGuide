Hello everyone, In this project I made a traveller guide app by using react. There is a turkey map with all cities and all regions separately. You can can reach the places that you should visit when you went to that city. Their photos, names and also Google maps links. I created my own json file by using selenium library in JavaScript and I used it in my project.
